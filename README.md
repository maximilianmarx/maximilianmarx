### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Max, currently working as a Product Manager while studying Software Engineering. I was always curious about how digital systems work behind the scenes. That's why I started diving deeper into IT Security during my apprenticeship. I started to gain practical experience with Python, C, Assembly & Penetration Testing.
During the day I'm implementing Change Requests for our CRM software. At night I heavily enjoy Red Teaming.
